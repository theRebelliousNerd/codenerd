# codeNERD

A high-assurance Logic-First CLI coding agent built on the Neuro-Symbolic architecture.

**Kernel:** Google Mangle (Datalog) | **Runtime:** Go | **Philosophy:** Logic determines Reality; the Model merely describes it.

## Vision

The current generation of AI coding agents makes a category error: they ask LLMs to handle everything—creativity AND planning, insight AND memory, problem-solving AND self-correction—when LLMs excel at the former but struggle with the latter. codeNERD separates these concerns: the LLM remains the creative center where problems are understood, solutions are synthesized, and novel approaches emerge, while a deterministic Mangle kernel handles the executive functions that LLMs cannot reliably perform—planning, long-term memory, skill retention, and self-reflection. This architecture liberates the LLM to focus purely on what it does best while the harness ensures those creative outputs are channeled safely and consistently. The north star is an autonomous agent that pairs unbounded creative problem-solving with formal correctness guarantees: months-long sessions without context exhaustion, learned preferences without retraining, and parallel sub-agents—all orchestrated by logic, not luck. We are building the first coding agent where creative power and deterministic safety coexist by design.

## Core Principle: Inversion of Control

codeNERD inverts the traditional agent hierarchy:

- **LLM as Creative Center** - Problem-solving, solution synthesis, goal-crafting, and insight remain with the model
- **Logic as Executive** - Planning, memory, orchestration, and safety derive from deterministic Mangle rules
- **Transduction Interface** - NL↔Logic atom conversion channels creativity through formal structure

## Skills

Use skills to get specialized knowledge for different tasks. Invoke with `/skill:<name>`.

### codenerd-builder

**When:** Implementing codeNERD components - kernel, transducers, shards, virtual predicates, TDD loops, Piggyback Protocol, or any neuro-symbolic architecture work.

### mangle-programming

**When:** Writing or debugging Mangle logic - schemas, rules, queries, aggregations, recursive closures, or understanding Datalog semantics. Complete language reference from basics to production optimization.

### research-builder

**When:** Building knowledge ingestion systems - ResearcherShard, llms.txt parsing, Context7-style processing, knowledge atom extraction, 4-tier memory persistence, or specialist hydration.

### rod-builder

**When:** Implementing browser automation - web scraping, CDP event handling, session management, DOM projection, or the semantic browser peripheral.

### skill-creator

**When:** Creating or updating skills - designing SKILL.md structure, bundled resources, reference organization, or skill metadata.

## Key Implementation Files

| Component | Location | Purpose |
|-----------|----------|---------|
| Kernel | [internal/core/kernel.go](internal/core/kernel.go) | Mangle engine + fact management |
| Policy | [internal/mangle/policy.gl](internal/mangle/policy.gl) | IDB rules (20 sections) |
| Schemas | [internal/mangle/schemas.gl](internal/mangle/schemas.gl) | EDB declarations |
| VirtualStore | [internal/core/virtual_store.go](internal/core/virtual_store.go) | FFI to external systems |
| ShardManager | [internal/core/shard_manager.go](internal/core/shard_manager.go) | Shard lifecycle |
| Transducer | [internal/perception/transducer.go](internal/perception/transducer.go) | NL→Atoms |
| Emitter | [internal/articulation/emitter.go](internal/articulation/emitter.go) | Atoms→NL (Piggyback) |

## Development Guidelines

### Mangle Rules

- All predicates require `Decl` in schemas.gl before use
- Variables are UPPERCASE, constants are `/lowercase`
- Negation requires all variables bound elsewhere (safety)
- End every statement with `.`

### Go Patterns

- Shards implement the `Shard` interface with `Execute(ctx, task) (string, error)`
- Facts use `ToAtom()` to convert Go structs to Mangle AST
- Virtual predicates abstract external APIs into logic queries

### Testing

- Run `go test ./...` before committing
- Build with `go build -o nerd.exe ./cmd/nerd`

### Git

- Push to GitHub regularly
- Use conventional commits

## Quick Reference

**OODA Loop:** Observe (Transducer) → Orient (Spreading Activation) → Decide (Mangle Engine) → Act (Virtual Store)

**Shard Types:**

- Type A (Generalists): Spawn → Execute → Die. RAM only.
- Type B (Specialists): Pre-populated with knowledge. SQLite-backed.

**Constitutional Safety:** Every action requires `permitted(Action)` to derive. Default deny.
