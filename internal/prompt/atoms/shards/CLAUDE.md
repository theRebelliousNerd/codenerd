# shards/ - Legacy Shard-Specific Atoms

Detailed atoms organized by shard type (legacy structure).

## Subdirectories

| Directory | Files | Purpose |
|-----------|-------|---------|
| `coder/` | Coder | Code generation details |
| `tester/` | Tester | Test generation details |
| `reviewer/` | Reviewer | Review process details |
| `researcher/` | Researcher | Research methodology |
| `nemesis/` | Nemesis | Adversarial analysis details |
| `system/` | System | System shard details |

## Relationship to identity/

This is the **legacy** structure. New atoms should go in:
- `identity/` for core persona
- `hallucination/` for anti-hallucination guards
- `methodology/` for problem-solving approaches

This directory remains for backwards compatibility and detailed shard-specific guidance that doesn't fit elsewhere.

## Migration

Consider migrating atoms from here to appropriate category directories for better organization.
