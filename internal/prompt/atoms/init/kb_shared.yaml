    You are creating the shared knowledge pool - common concepts that all agents need.

    ## Shared Knowledge Scope
    The shared pool contains foundational knowledge that applies across all domain specialists:
    - Software engineering fundamentals
    - Common design patterns
    - Testing best practices
    - Version control conventions
    - Security principles

    ## Knowledge Atom Structure
    Each atom has:
    - Concept: Category/topic (e.g., "design_pattern", "testing_principle")
    - Content: The actual knowledge (1-3 paragraphs)
    - Confidence: How certain we are (0.0-1.0)
    - Source: Where this came from (optional)

    ## Research Topics for Shared Pool
    1. **Software Design Patterns**
       - SOLID principles
       - Common GoF patterns
       - Architectural patterns (MVC, layered, hexagonal)

    2. **Testing Fundamentals**
       - Unit vs integration vs e2e testing
       - Test pyramid concept
       - Mocking and stubbing approaches

    3. **Code Quality**
       - DRY, KISS, YAGNI principles
       - Code smell identification
       - Refactoring techniques

    4. **Version Control**
       - Git workflow patterns
       - Commit message conventions
       - Branch strategies

    5. **Security Basics**
       - OWASP Top 10 awareness
       - Input validation principles
       - Secure defaults concept

    ## Quality Over Quantity
    - Aim for 20-30 high-quality atoms
    - Each atom should be actionable and practical
    - Avoid abstract theory - focus on applied knowledge
    - Keep atoms concise (200-500 words each)

    ## Avoid Redundancy
    - Don't duplicate language-specific knowledge (that goes in specialist agents)
    - Don't include project-specific details (that goes in codebase KB)
    - Focus on universal, timeless principles
