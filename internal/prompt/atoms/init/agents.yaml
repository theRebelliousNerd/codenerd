    You may be consulted to help recommend Type 3 persistent agents for this project.

    ## Agent Recommendation Criteria
    Type 3 agents are domain specialists with pre-loaded knowledge bases.
    Recommend agents based on detected technologies and project characteristics.

    ## Agent Categories

    ### Language-Specific Agents
    - **GoExpert**: For Go projects (detect: go.mod, *.go files)
    - **PythonExpert**: For Python projects (detect: requirements.txt, *.py files)
    - **TSExpert**: For TypeScript projects (detect: tsconfig.json, *.ts files)
    - **RustExpert**: For Rust projects (detect: Cargo.toml, *.rs files)
    - **JavaExpert**: For Java projects (detect: pom.xml, build.gradle)

    ### Framework-Specific Agents
    - **WebAPIExpert**: For REST/GraphQL APIs (detect: web frameworks, API patterns)
    - **FrontendExpert**: For frontend apps (detect: React, Vue, Angular, Svelte)
    - **BubbleTeaExpert**: For TUI apps (detect: bubbletea dependency)
    - **CobraExpert**: For CLI tools (detect: cobra dependency)

    ### Technology-Specific Agents
    - **RodExpert**: For browser automation with Rod (detect: rod dependency)
    - **BrowserAutomationExpert**: For Chromedp/Puppeteer/Playwright
    - **MangleExpert**: For Datalog/Mangle logic (detect: .gl files, mangle dependency)
    - **LLMIntegrationExpert**: For LLM integrations (detect: OpenAI/Anthropic SDKs)
    - **DatabaseExpert**: For database-heavy apps (detect: GORM, SQLx, Prisma, TypeORM)

    ### Always Recommended
    - **SecurityAuditor**: Security scanning and vulnerability detection
    - **TestArchitect**: Test strategy and coverage analysis

    ## Agent Structure
    Each recommended agent should include:
    - Name: Clear, descriptive identifier
    - Type: Domain category (language, framework, security, etc.)
    - Description: 1-2 sentences explaining the agent's expertise
    - Topics: Research topics for KB hydration (3-5 specific topics)
    - Permissions: Required capabilities (read_file, code_graph, exec_cmd, network, browser)
    - Priority: Importance score (1-100, higher = more critical)
    - Reason: Why this agent is needed for this specific project

    ## Prioritization
    - Language experts: Priority 90
    - Framework experts: Priority 80
    - Security/Testing: Priority 85
    - Technology-specific: Priority 70
    - Optional specialists: Priority 60

    Recommend 3-8 agents total - enough coverage without overwhelming.
