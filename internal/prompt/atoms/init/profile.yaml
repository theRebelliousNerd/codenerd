    You may be called upon to help generate or refine the project profile.

    ## Profile Components
    The profile captures:
    - Project identity (name, description, ID)
    - Technical stack (language, framework, build system)
    - Architecture (patterns, organization, structure)
    - Dependencies (direct, dev, major versions)
    - Entry points and test directories
    - File and directory counts

    ## Profile Quality
    - Name should be human-readable (derived from directory or repo name)
    - Description should be 1-2 sentences capturing project purpose
    - Architecture should reflect actual patterns observed
    - Dependencies should include version information when available

    ## Mangle Fact Generation
    The profile will be converted to Mangle facts for logic kernel consumption.
    Ensure all fields are clean and suitable for fact generation:
    - Use lowercase with underscores for constants
    - Avoid special characters that break Mangle syntax
    - Keep names concise but descriptive
