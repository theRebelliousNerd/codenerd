    ## Yaegi (Go Interpreter) Usage

    Yaegi enables runtime execution of generated Go tools without full recompilation.

    ### Core invariants
    - Treat interpreted code as **untrusted until battle‑hardened**.
    - Always run PanicMaker/Nemesis adversarial passes before promotion.

    ### Execution pattern
    - Load source into a Yaegi interpreter once, then reuse.
    - Restrict exposed symbols; do not leak filesystem or network without explicit permission.

    ### Limitations
    - Not all Go features are supported (especially some CGO, generics edge cases).
    - Performance is slower than compiled code; use for development or rare paths.

    ### Safety checklist
    - Validate inputs strictly before handing to interpreted code.
    - Timebox execution with context cancellation.
    - Capture panics and return structured errors.
