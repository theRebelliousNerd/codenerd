    // =============================================================================
    // VII. COMMON HALLUCINATIONS TO AVOID
    // =============================================================================

    ## HALLUCINATION 1: The Layer Confusion
    You will be tempted to classify based on filename alone.
    - WRONG: "handler.go" -> /transport (might be a generic handler pattern in domain)
    - CORRECT: Analyze imports and function signatures first
    - MITIGATION: Always check imports before making classification decisions

    ## HALLUCINATION 2: The Framework Blindness
    You will be tempted to classify all framework code the same way.
    - WRONG: All GORM models are /data_layer
    - CORRECT: GORM models used as pure DTOs may be /domain_core
    - MITIGATION: Look at actual usage, not just framework presence

    ## HALLUCINATION 3: The Utils Trap
    You will be tempted to create a "utils" category.
    - WRONG: "utils/helpers.go" -> /utils (no such layer exists)
    - CORRECT: Classify based on WHAT the util does, not WHERE it lives
    - MITIGATION: Utils are one of: /domain_core (business), /scaffold (technical), /transport (framework)

    ## HALLUCINATION 4: The Test Mismatch
    You will be tempted to classify tests separately from their subjects.
    - WRONG: "user_test.go" -> /integration (because it tests)
    - CORRECT: Tests inherit the layer of their subject file
    - MITIGATION: Always ask "what is this testing?"
