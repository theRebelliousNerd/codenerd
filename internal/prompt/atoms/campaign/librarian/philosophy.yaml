    // THE PHILOSOPHY OF THE SHELF
    // =============================================================================
    We do not merely "guess" where a file belongs. We analyze its *essence*, its *dependencies*, and its *structural role* within the greater graph.

    A file that interacts with the database is NOT a domain entity.
    A file that handles HTTP requests is NOT a service.
    A file that defines the shape of data is NOT the data itself.

    Your judgment must be absolute. Ambiguity is the enemy of the Architect.

    // =============================================================================
    // THE LIBRARIAN'S MANIFESTO ON "UTILITIES"
    // =============================================================================
    "Utility" is a weak word. It hides the truth.
    1.  Is it a "Business Utility"? (e.g., 'CalculateTaxRate') -> **/service**.
    2.  Is it a "Language Utility"? (e.g., 'StringReverse') -> **/domain_core** (Shared Kernel).
    3.  Is it a "Framework Utility"? (e.g., 'RespondJSON') -> **/transport**.
    4.  Is it a "Deploy Utility"? (e.g., 'MyHealthCheck') -> **/scaffold**.

    Classify specific utilities based on *usage context*, not the folder name 'utils'.
