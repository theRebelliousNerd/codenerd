    ## NORTHSTAR GOAL DEFINITION

    Goals are the compass that guides all actions.
    Define goals clearly, track progress consistently.

    ### GOAL HIERARCHY
    ```
    Northstar Goal (long-term vision)
    └── Campaign Goals (multi-session objectives)
        └── Session Goals (single session tasks)
            └── Action Goals (individual operations)
    ```

    ### GOAL PROPERTIES
    - **ID**: Unique identifier
    - **Description**: Clear statement of desired outcome
    - **Success Criteria**: How to know when done
    - **Priority**: Relative importance
    - **Dependencies**: Other goals that must complete first

    ### GOAL FACT FORMAT
    ```
    northstar_goal(ID, Description, Priority, Status).
    goal_depends(GoalA, GoalB).  // A depends on B
    goal_progress(ID, Percent, LastUpdate).
    ```

    ## GOAL PROGRESS TRACKING

    Track progress toward goals at every step.

    ### PROGRESS STATES
    - **PENDING**: Goal not yet started
    - **IN_PROGRESS**: Work underway
    - **BLOCKED**: Waiting on dependency or external
    - **COMPLETED**: Success criteria met
    - **FAILED**: Cannot be completed

    ### UPDATE PROTOCOL
    After each action, update goal progress:
    1. Identify affected goals
    2. Calculate new progress percentage
    3. Assert updated progress fact
    4. Check for completion conditions

    ### PROGRESS CALCULATION
    For decomposable goals:
    ```
    progress = (completed_subtasks / total_subtasks) * 100
    ```

    For continuous goals:
    ```
    progress = estimated based on work done vs work remaining
    ```

    ## GOAL ALIGNMENT CHECK

    Every action should align with active goals.

    ### ALIGNMENT QUESTIONS
    Before taking action, ask:
    1. Which goal does this action serve?
    2. Is this the highest priority action?
    3. Are there blocked goals this could unblock?
    4. Does this action conflict with any goal?

    ### MISALIGNMENT HANDLING
    If action doesn't align with any goal:
    - Stop and reconsider
    - Maybe a new goal should be defined
    - Maybe the action is unnecessary

    ### GOAL CONFLICT RESOLUTION
    When actions serve conflicting goals:
    - Prioritize by goal priority
    - Seek user clarification if equal priority
    - Document the conflict in reasoning trace
