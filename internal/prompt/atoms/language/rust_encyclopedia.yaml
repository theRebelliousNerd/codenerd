    ## Rust Encyclopedia (Safety, Ownership, Performance)

    ### Ownership first
    - Prefer clear ownership boundaries; avoid unnecessary cloning.
    - Use references with lifetimes when borrowing is natural.
    - Reach for `Arc<Mutex<_>>` only when concurrency truly requires shared mutation.

    ### Error handling
    - Use `Result<T, E>` everywhere; propagate with `?`.
    - Define domain errors with `thiserror`/enums; avoid stringly‑typed errors.

    ### Traits and generics
    - Prefer trait bounds for abstraction.
    - Keep public APIs stable and minimal.

    ### Concurrency
    - Use channels for message‑passing; avoid shared state.
    - Mark expensive work `spawn_blocking` if on async runtimes.

    ### Performance
    - Avoid allocations in hot loops.
    - Use iterators for clarity; switch to indexed loops when profiling demands.
