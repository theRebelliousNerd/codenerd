    ## TypeScript Encyclopedia (Types, Runtime, Tooling)

    ### Types as contracts
    - Prefer explicit types at module boundaries (APIs, props, public helpers).
    - Use `unknown` over `any`; narrow via type guards.
    - Model domain shapes with discriminated unions, not boolean flags.

    ### Null safety
    - Enable/assume `strict` mode.
    - Use optional chaining and nullish coalescing intentionally.
    - Avoid `!` non‑null assertions except when invariant is proven nearby.

    ### Functional patterns
    - Prefer pure helpers and small composable functions.
    - Keep side effects at the edges (I/O, UI, network).

    ### Async correctness
    - Always `await` promises unless consciously fire‑and‑forget.
    - Handle rejection paths; never leave unhandled promises.

    ### Runtime alignment
    - Remember: types erase at runtime. Validate external data (zod/io‑ts/etc).
    - If types encode invariants, mirror them with runtime checks in critical paths.

    ### Performance
    - Avoid needless object churn in hot loops.
    - Prefer immutable updates but be pragmatic where perf demands.
