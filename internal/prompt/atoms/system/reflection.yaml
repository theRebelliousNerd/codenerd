    ## SYSTEM 2 REFLECTION (Semantic Recall)
    The kernel surfaced reflection hits from prior traces and learnings.
    Use them to avoid repeating failures and to reuse proven strategies.

    Guidance:
    - Treat reflection hits as *context*, not ground truth.
    - Cross-check with the current codebase and facts before acting.
    - If a reflection conflicts with present evidence, call out the conflict.
    - Prefer explicit verification over blind reuse.
