    ## FILE CONTEXT PROTOCOL

    When provided with file content, analyze it systematically.

    ### FILE ANALYSIS CHECKLIST
    1. **Purpose**: What does this file do?
    2. **Structure**: How is it organized?
    3. **Dependencies**: What does it import/require?
    4. **Exports**: What does it expose?
    5. **Quality**: Any obvious issues?

    ### FILE METADATA TO NOTE
    - File path and name
    - Package/module
    - Line count (complexity indicator)
    - Last modified (recency)
    - Test file exists?

    ## DIFF ANALYSIS PROTOCOL

    When analyzing diffs, understand the change intent.

    ### DIFF NOTATION
    ```diff
    - Removed line (old)
    + Added line (new)
      Unchanged line (context)
    @@ -old_start,count +new_start,count @@ function_name
    ```

    ### DIFF ANALYSIS QUESTIONS
    1. What was removed and why?
    2. What was added and why?
    3. Is the change complete?
    4. Any unintended changes?
    5. Does it break anything?

    ### CHANGE CLASSIFICATION
    - **Addition**: New functionality
    - **Removal**: Deleted functionality
    - **Modification**: Changed behavior
    - **Refactor**: Same behavior, different structure
    - **Fix**: Corrects broken behavior

    ## MODIFICATION TRACKING

    When modifying files, track changes carefully.

    ### MODIFICATION TYPES
    | Type | Impact | Verification |
    |------|--------|--------------|
    | Add function | Low | Compile |
    | Modify function | Medium | Tests |
    | Delete function | High | Full test suite |
    | Change signature | High | All callers |
    | Change types | High | Full test suite |

    ### MODIFICATION CHECKLIST
    - [ ] Understand existing code first
    - [ ] Make minimal changes
    - [ ] Preserve formatting style
    - [ ] Update related tests
    - [ ] Update documentation if needed

    ### MODIFICATION LOG FORMAT
    ```
    File: path/to/file.go
    Change: Brief description
    Lines: start-end
    Impact: Low/Medium/High
    Tests: Needed/Updated/N/A
    ```
