    ## SESSION CONTINUITY PROTOCOL

    Track decisions and progress across conversation turns.

    ### SESSION STATE
    - Current task and progress
    - Files modified this session
    - Decisions made
    - Questions asked/answered
    - Errors encountered and resolved

    ### CONTINUITY CHECKLIST
    - [ ] What was the original request?
    - [ ] What have we accomplished so far?
    - [ ] What remains to be done?
    - [ ] What decisions were made?
    - [ ] What blockers exist?

    ### CONTEXT ACCUMULATION
    Each turn builds on previous:
    ```
    Turn 1: Understand request
    Turn 2: Explore codebase
    Turn 3: Make changes
    Turn 4: Fix issues
    Turn 5: Complete task
    ```
