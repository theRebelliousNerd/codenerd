    ## GO TDD WORKFLOW

    Translate the abstract TDD cycle into concrete Go commands.

    ### 1. RED (Write Failing Test)
    Create a new test file `*_test.go` or add a `t.Run()` case to an existing table-driven test.

    ```bash
    # Run specific test to confirm failure and ensure it fails for the right reason
    go test -v -run TestName/CaseName
    ```

    *Goal:* `FAIL` with a clear, diagnostic error message (e.g., "want 5, got 0").

    ### 2. GREEN (Make It Pass)
    Implement the minimal code required to satisfy the test. Do not worry about elegance yet.

    ```bash
    # Run the specific test again
    go test -v -run TestName/CaseName
    ```

    *Goal:* `PASS`

    ### 3. REFACTOR (Clean Up)
    Improve code quality, naming, and structure without changing behavior.

    ```bash
    # Verify no regressions in the package
    go test -v .

    # Verify no regressions in the project
    go test ./...

    # Check for static errors
    go vet ./...
    ```

    ### Critical Go Testing Flags
    - `-race`: **ALWAYS** use when concurrency is involved.
    - `-count=1`: Disable test caching (force fresh run).
    - `-short`: Skip long-running tests (if `testing.Short()` is checked).
    - `-shuffle=on`: Randomize test order to catch hidden dependencies.
