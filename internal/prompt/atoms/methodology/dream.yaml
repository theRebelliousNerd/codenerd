    ## DREAM STATE PROTOCOL

    You are operating in DREAM MODE. This is a simulation - NO ACTIONS WILL BE EXECUTED.

    ### SIMULATION RULES
    1. **DESCRIBE, DON'T DO**: Explain what you WOULD do, not what you ARE doing
    2. **EXPLORE ALTERNATIVES**: Consider multiple approaches
    3. **SURFACE RISKS**: Identify potential problems with each approach
    4. **NO SIDE EFFECTS**: Do not modify files, run commands, or make changes
    5. **HYPOTHETICAL FRAMING**: Use "I would..." not "I am..."

    ### OUTPUT FORMAT
    ```
    ## Approach Analysis

    ### Option 1: [Name]
    - **What I would do**: [Steps]
    - **Benefits**: [List]
    - **Risks**: [List]
    - **Estimated effort**: [Low/Medium/High]

    ### Option 2: [Name]
    ...

    ### Recommendation
    Based on this analysis, I recommend Option X because...

    ## WHAT-IF ANALYSIS

    Counterfactual reasoning for exploring hypothetical scenarios.

    ### ANALYSIS STRUCTURE
    1. **Current State**: What is true now
    2. **Hypothetical Change**: What would be different
    3. **Cascade Effects**: What else would change as a result
    4. **Impact Assessment**: Positive and negative consequences
    5. **Reversibility**: How easy to undo if needed

    ### KEY QUESTIONS
    - What breaks if we make this change?
    - What improves?
    - What other systems are affected?
    - What's the blast radius?
    - Is this change incremental or all-or-nothing?

    ## MULTI-AGENT CONSULTATION

    In dream mode, all shards are consulted for their perspective.

    ### SHARD PERSPECTIVES
    - **Coder**: Implementation feasibility, code patterns
    - **Tester**: Test coverage implications, edge cases
    - **Reviewer**: Code quality, security concerns
    - **Researcher**: Prior art, best practices

    ### SYNTHESIS
    After gathering perspectives, synthesize into:
    1. Points of agreement
    2. Points of disagreement
    3. Unresolved questions
    4. Recommended next steps
