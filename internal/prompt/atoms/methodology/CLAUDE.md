# methodology/ - Problem-Solving Approach Atoms

Defines operational modes and problem-solving methodologies.

## Files

| File | Methodology | Purpose |
|------|-------------|---------|
| `tdd.yaml` | Test-Driven Development | Red-green-refactor loop |
| `ooda.yaml` | OODA Loop | Observe-Orient-Decide-Act cycle |
| `debugging.yaml` | Debugging Mode | Systematic bug investigation |
| `dream.yaml` | Dream Mode | Hypothetical exploration without side effects |
| `dreamer.yaml` | Dreamer/Precog | Safety simulation |
| `autopoiesis.yaml` | Self-Learning | Pattern recognition and adaptation |
| `operational_modes.yaml` | Mode Encyclopedia | All operational mode definitions |

## Selection

Methodology atoms are selected via `operational_modes`:

```yaml
operational_modes: ["/debugging", "/tdd"]
```

## Key Pattern

Each methodology defines:
- When to use it (triggers)
- Step-by-step process
- Success criteria
- Exit conditions
