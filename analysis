# Codebase Analysis Limitation

Unable to perform codebase exploration as no actual source code files were provided in the prompt.

## Available Information
From the research results, this appears to be a Go project named "codeNERD" with the following characteristics:
- High-assurance Logic-First CLI coding agent
- Built on Neuro-Symbolic architecture
- Uses Charmbracelet libraries for terminal UI
- SQLite with vector extensions for data storage
- Google's generative AI SDK integration
- Tools for web scraping, code parsing, and script execution

## Required for Analysis
To perform a proper codebase exploration, please provide:
1. The actual source code files (.go files)
2. Project structure (directories and file organization)
3. Configuration files (go.mod, go.sum, etc.)
4. Any relevant documentation or README files

Without the actual code files, I cannot analyze implementation details, architecture patterns, or provide meaningful insights into the codebase structure and functionality.
