# Initial Concept
A high-assurance Logic-First CLI coding agent that separates creative intelligence from deterministic control.

# Product Guide: codeNERD

## Overview
codeNERD is a high-assurance, logic-first coding agent framework. It implements a Neuro-Symbolic architecture that separates creative intelligence (LLMs) from deterministic executive control (Google Mangle logic kernel).

## Key Features
- **Logic-First Execution:** Decisions are driven by a Datalog-based kernel (Mangle) rather than probabilistic LLM planning.
- **Neuro-Symbolic Partnership:** LLMs provide creative problem-solving while Mangle ensures safety, memory, and orchestration.
- **Shard-Based Agents:** Specialized, ephemeral sub-kernels (Coder, Tester, Reviewer) for targeted task execution.
- **Autopoietic Learning:** A self-learning system that evolves its own tools and policy rules through interaction and adversarial testing.
- **Adversarial Hardening:** Built-in "Nemesis" and "Panic Maker" components that proactively attempt to find and fix vulnerabilities in generated code.

## Target Audience
- Software engineers building high-reliability systems.
- Developers interested in neuro-symbolic AI and formal logic in coding agents.
- Teams requiring strict safety and traceability in AI-assisted development.
