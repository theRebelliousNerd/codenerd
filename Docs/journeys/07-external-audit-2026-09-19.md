# 07 — External audit, 2026-09-19: findings, verification and routing

Two external audits of `40c6f61a` reached Steve on 2026-09-19 (his downloads, `AUDIT.md` and
`AUDIT (1).md`, with `probe-output.txt`): a seven-finding capability and wiring audit (F1-F7) and
an additive "wave 2" of sixteen (N01-N16). Both are source-anchored; wave 1 reproduced three
findings and wave 2 eight mechanisms with isolated Go probes. This file is the tracked record:
what each finding claims, whether it was checked against the code here, where it is routed, and
what landed. The audits themselves stay where Steve put them.

Their acceptance criterion, adopted as ours: evidence cannot be borrowed, dropped, used after
becoming stale, or detached from the mutations it is supposed to describe.

## Status

- last updated: 2026-09-19 12:40
- landed: F7 (`247a2402`), F6 (`ac5c9b03`).
- next, hand-built in this order: F3, F5, F1, N03, N07, N01, then F2/F4 with N02 before any
  R2+ campaign run.
- next, as codeNERD ladder briefs (one or two files, tool code, symptom and evidence in hand):
  N10, N09, N05, N06, N14, N04.

## Routing rule

Hand-built: completion-gate, verdict, rollback and scheduling-authority logic (the model does not
widen the rule that constrains it), and anything that stops codeNERD from running. Everything else
that is one or two files with the evidence in hand is a ladder brief for codeNERD -- these are
real defects in its own tools, found by someone else, which is the best rung-1 material the ladder
has had. Larger items wait for their rung.

## Findings

"Verified" means the claimed mechanism was found in the code at HEAD on 2026-09-19 (a file:line
read, or a run where one is named). It is not a reproduction unless the row says so.

| ID | Audit priority | Finding | Verified here | Route | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| F1 | P1 | Transient turn facts keyed by verb, not execution: `turn_evidence(Verb,…)`, `turn_gate(Verb,…)`, unkeyed `hollow_success` on the kernel `CloneForTask` shares; cleanup can sweep another executor's facts | schema + `CloneForTask` read | hand | open |
| F2 | P1 | Campaign `spawnTask` takes the string route and drops the typed outcome, so `/unverified` with a nil error completes the task (the ladder's C3/C4) | known (C3/C4) | hand, before R2+ campaigns | open |
| F3 | P1 | Gate order build→tests→coverage→vet→removed-tests→**critic**→close: the critic edits after the last guard, and the final closure refreshes tests only (`gateTests(…, false)`, second return discarded) | `executor_tools.go` order, `change_evidence.go` | hand | open |
| F4 | P1 | Declared write sets lock and snapshot; actual writes outside them are neither isolated nor rolled back (the ladder's C4) | known (C4) | hand, before R2+ campaigns | open |
| F5 | P1 | `go vet` findings in files the turn did not write become `VerifyPassed`; a cause in `state.go` (a mutex added) diagnosed in `use.go` is discarded | `change_gates.go:77` | hand | open |
| F6 | P1 | A deleted test is excused when any test anywhere shares its name | `workspaceTestNames`; fails on `247a2402` as the audit said | hand | **landed `ac5c9b03`** (a test moves only within its package directory, among files the default build includes; a copy behind `//go:build ignore` is a removal) |
| F7 | P2 | Rollback deletes a pre-existing empty file (`exists = pre != ""`) | reproduced on `f91c39b6` | hand | **landed `247a2402`** (also: unreadable ≠ absent in the snapshot, the current-state read and the test-baseline overlay; an undo that fails stays written) |
| N01 | P1 | Build/test gates run only when a `.go` file was written; policy demands them for every write, so non-Go work has no affirmative completion path | `build_verify.go:222,297,602` | hand (completion contract) | open |
| N02 | P1 | `getEligibleTasks` falls back to an in-memory scan whenever the kernel's answer is empty -- including a valid "wait" | `orchestrator_phases.go:94-98` | hand (scheduling authority) | open |
| N03 | P1 | Three failed phase checkpoints call `completePhase`: `/completed`, progress, a success observation | `orchestrator_tasks.go:144-152` | hand (completion) | open |
| N04 | P1 | `apply_edits` rollback visits `succeeded` only; a target whose write failed part-way is left corrupt | `apply_edits.go:332-379` | codeNERD brief | open |
| N05 | P1 | Impacted-test selection follows two dependency edges, not a fixed point | `test_dependency.go` ("simplified - could query kernel for full transitivity") | codeNERD brief | open |
| N06 | P2 | Coverage-gap report counts production callers as test coverage | not yet checked | codeNERD brief | open |
| N07 | P1 | `run_impacted_tests` is a test execution by name alone; a dry run or an empty selection mints executed-test evidence | `tool_gate.go:164-167`, `run_impacted_tests.go:219` | hand (evidence) | open |
| N08 | P1 | The registered CodeDOM reader is per-line regex: misses generic funcs and `async def`, invents declarations inside raw strings | not yet checked | R2 (route readers to the parser) | open |
| N09 | P2 | `get_element` returns the first same-named element; `A.Close` vs `B.Close` silently resolves to one | `elements.go` first match | codeNERD brief | open |
| N10 | P2 | The edit delimiter guard counts only the replaced fragment, so a valid edit inside a multiline literal is refused | `lines.go:171-179`; R1-4d's log has one such refusal (08:34:57) to classify | codeNERD brief | open |
| N11 | P1 | A failed reread supersedes the successful observation of the same revision | not yet checked | R2 (working policy + store) | open |
| N12 | P1 | Aggregate observations are stamped with the focused file's revision | not yet checked | R2 | open |
| N13 | P1 | The working-context archive scope is random per executor (`rand.Text()`), so a resumed executor cannot reopen it | `working_context.go:125-126` | R2 | open |
| N14 | P2 | Co-use statistics settle every nil-error turn as success, `/unverified` included | `executor.go:913-917` | codeNERD brief | open |
| N15 | P2 | The impacted-test provider is process-global, last workspace wins | `run_impacted_tests.go:63-98` | R2 | open |
| N16 | P2 | A contained symlink stops snapshot certification (fail-closed, a capability limit) | `change.go:173-174` | decision (Steve) | open |
