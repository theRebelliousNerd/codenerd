| Mangle load failure | Boot dump `debug_program_ERROR.mg` | Decl, safety, stratification |
| LLM/client failure | Perception/articulation errors | Client factory, config engines |
| Store/IO failure | Persist errors | Context cancel, wrap errors, sqlite pragmas |
| Race/leak | Flaky tests, hung sessions | `-race`, goroutine lifecycle |
