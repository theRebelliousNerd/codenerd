# codeNERD Component Ledger

Living status matrix for the dogfood sweep: exercise each component through the
CLI, then upgrade it. Update after every loop. `EXERCISED` = driven live through
the CLI on the target path. `UPGRADED` = a real defect it surfaced was fixed +
tested + committed.

## Components

### ✅🔄 Campaign orchestrator — `internal/campaign`
- **Exercise:** `nerd campaign start "Audit internal/<pkg> ..." --type audit --timeout 30m`
- **Status:** heavily exercised (runs 1–13). Many upgrades landed; run 14 verifies the latest three.
- **Upgrades:**
  - F-TOOL-1 — permit `/grep` + `/search_code` in constitution.mg.
  - F-SCHED-2 — scoped task snapshot + swap-resilient scheduler (fixed completion→restart loop).
  - F-CKPT-2 — bound phase-checkpoint failure retries (no deadlock on repeated FAIL).
  - F-STALL-1 / F-TASK-1 — failed-task deadlock + pathless document tasks.
  - F-DOC-1 / F-DOC-2 — document-task fallback + degenerate-generation guard (anti-repetition retry + honest placeholder).
  - **F-DURABLE-1** (c18cbc6d) — persist research/audit task output as a durable `/doc` artifact; the reviewer had nothing to verify before this.
  - **F-HOLLOW-1** (84228fc1) — retry empty `/research` responses (empty EOF was marked "completed").
  - **F-VERIFY-1** (84228fc1) — route analytical `/verify` tasks to research+persist instead of a bare `go build`.
- **Open:** run 14 (fixed binary) must show phases 0/1/2 `/shard_validation` pass on merit. Contract #4 was the last non-A+ contract.

### ✅ FlightRecorder / tracer — `runtime/trace`, `cmd/nerd/main.go`
- **Exercise:** any `nerd campaign` run (tracer starts in main.go).
- **Upgrade:** F-TRACE-1 (bf7c4dd5) — `isCampaignInvocation()` gates the tracer off for campaigns; it OOM-crashed (`fatal error: traceRegion: out of memory`) under campaign goroutine churn. Verified live run 10.

### ✅ Shell tools — `internal/tools/shell`
- **Exercise:** reviewer/coder shards issuing `run_command`; run 11 audit.
- **Upgrade:** F-CMD-2 (bf7c4dd5, 996689d1) — cross-platform read-only builtins (ls/cat/wc/head/tail/grep/rg) + route not-found PowerShell cmdlets (`Get-ChildItem`, `Select-String`) through PowerShell on Windows. Verified run 11.

### ✅ World model — `internal/world`, `internal/core/defaults/policy/codedom_core.mg`
- **Exercise:** world scan at boot; `internal/world` self-audit (run 13).
- **Upgrade:** mock_file Cartesian explosion (62cca3e4) — `mock_file` paired every test×source (~500k, overflowed the 500000 kernel fact limit). Fixed with a `file_dir` per-package join key (scanner emits companion `file_dir` fact). Verified: world loads clean.

### ✅ Reviewer prompt atoms — `internal/prompt/atoms/shards/reviewer`
- **Exercise:** `/shard_validation` checkpoints during any campaign.
- **Upgrade:** `tool_steering.yaml` (3364305b) — steer the reviewer to dedicated tools (search_code/read_file/list_files) over fragile shell, and always emit a complete verdict. Produced the first-ever `/shard_validation` merit pass (run 12).

### 🔄 Session executor — `internal/session`
- **Exercise:** run 12 self-audit (completed clean, 4/4 phases).
- **Flagged (not yet fixed):** F-TOOL-3 (edit_file blocked by safety gate in `nerd run` path); F-ROUTE-1 (`/research` invalid action fact "got 2").

### ⬜ Articulation — `internal/articulation`
- **Note:** the empty-response symptom (`Fallback parse: empty response ... EOF`) surfaces here; root cause was upstream (empty subagent response). Worth a dedicated exercise: does articulation degrade gracefully on empty/truncated model output?

### ⬜ Not yet exercised through the CLI
- Kernel — `internal/core` (fact flow, derivation, `next_action`).
- Mangle policy — `internal/mangle`, `internal/core/defaults/policy/`.
- Prompt compiler / JIT — `internal/prompt` (atom selection, budget).
- Perception — `internal/perception` (intent classification).
- VirtualStore — `internal/core/virtual_store.go` (action routing).
- Tools/core — `internal/tools/core` (file_ops: edit_file uniqueness guard; non-string `new_text` coercion — see dogfood plan backup targets).
- Config — `internal/config`.
- Features — `internal/features` (`Summary()` prints `*bool` addresses under `%v` — `features.go:175-188`; logged at `user_config.go:477`. Unprotected + untested — ideal `nerd run` self-improvement target).
- Research tools — `internal/tools/research` (context7).
- Autopoiesis / Ouroboros — tool generation.
- Memory / context / reflection — `internal/context`, reflection config.
