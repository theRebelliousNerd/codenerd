```sql
CREATE TABLE teacher AS
SELECT ID, Name
FROM volunteer
WHERE Role = '/teaching';
```

--------------------------------

### Combining Rules with Join in Mangle

Source: https://github.com/google/mangle/blob/main/readthedocs/datalog.md

```

--------------------------------

### Example of Vocabulary Violation (Mangle)

Source: https://github.com/google/mangle/blob/main/docs/example_volunteer_db.md

```mangle
volunteer_interest(/v/1, /monday). # This does not look right.

```

--------------------------------

### Constructing Maps in Mangle

Source: https://github.com/google/mangle/blob/main/readthedocs/constructedtypes.md

[/a: /foo, /b: /bar]
[0: "zero", 1: "one",]
[/a: 1,]
```

--------------------------------

### Datalog Facts for Volunteers

Source: https://github.com/google/mangle/blob/main/readthedocs/datalog.md

```datalog
volunteer(1, "Aisha Salehi", /teaching).
volunteer(2, "Xin Watson", /workshop_facilitation).
volunteer(3, "Alyssa P. Hacker", /software_development).
```

--------------------------------

### SQL Translation of Combined Rules (JOIN)

Source: https://github.com/google/mangle/blob/main/readthedocs/datalog.md

The SQL equivalent of a Mangle rule with multiple atoms in the body, demonstrating a self-join on the 'volunteer' table. It finds individuals who have both '/teaching' and '/software_development' roles.

```SQL
CREATE TABLE teacher_and_coder AS
SELECT DISTINCT v1.ID, v1.Name
FROM volunteer AS v1
JOIN volunteer AS v2 ON v1.ID = v2.ID AND v1.Name = v2.Name
WHERE
    v1.Role = '/teaching'

```

--------------------------------

### Combining Rules with Union in Mangle

Source: https://github.com/google/mangle/blob/main/readthedocs/datalog.md

Demonstrates combining multiple rules using implicit union to create a new relation. Each rule defines a subset of the desired facts based on specific criteria. This is analogous to a UNION operation in SQL.

```Mangle
coding_workshop_candidate(ID, Name, /teaching) <-
    volunteer(ID, Name, /teaching).
coding_workshop_candidate(ID, Name, /software_development) <-
    volunteer(ID, Name, /software_development).
```

--------------------------------

```SQL
CREATE TABLE reachable AS
WITH RECURSIVE reachable_cte (StartPerson, EndPerson) AS (
    -- Base Case
    SELECT Person1, Person2
    FROM knows

    UNION ALL

    -- Recursive Step
    SELECT
        r.StartPerson,
        k.Person2
    FROM
        reachable_cte AS r
    JOIN
        knows AS k ON r.EndPerson = k.Person1
)
SELECT DISTINCT StartPerson, EndPerson
FROM reachable_cte;
```

--------------------------------

### Defining Recursive Rules in Mangle

Source: https://github.com/google/mangle/blob/main/readthedocs/datalog.md

Two rules defining a 'reachable' relation. The first rule is the base case, and the second rule is the recursive step, allowing the traversal of connections. This is analogous to finding paths in a graph.

```Mangle
reachable(X, Y) <-
    knows(X, Y).
reachable(X, Z) <-
    knows(X, Y),
    reachable(Y, Z).
```

--------------------------------

### Datalog Rule to Identify Teachers

Source: https://github.com/google/mangle/blob/main/readthedocs/datalog.md

```datalog
teacher(ID, Name) ⟸ volunteer(ID, Name, /teaching).
```

--------------------------------

### SQL Translation of Combined Rules (UNION)

Source: https://github.com/google/mangle/blob/main/readthedocs/datalog.md

The SQL equivalent of combining Mangle rules using the UNION operator. It selects distinct rows from the 'volunteer' table based on different 'Role' conditions, mirroring the behavior of the Mangle rules.

```SQL
CREATE TABLE coding_workshop_candidate AS
SELECT ID, Name, Role
FROM volunteer
WHERE Role = '/teaching'
UNION
SELECT ID, Name, Role
FROM volunteer
WHERE Role = '/software_development';
```

--------------------------------

parent(/oedipus, /ismene).
parent(/oedipus, /eteocles).
parent(/oedipus, /polynices).

sibling(Person1, Person2) ⟸
   parent(P, Person1), parent(P, Person2), Person1 != Person2.

### SQL: Translate Zero Developer Case using LEFT JOIN

Source: https://github.com/google/mangle/blob/main/readthedocs/aggregation.md

This SQL code translates the Datalog logic for handling projects with zero developers into a concrete implementation. It uses a `LEFT JOIN` between the `project` and `project_assignment` tables to include all projects, even those without assignments. `COALESCE` is used to ensure `TotalHours` is 0 for projects with no assignments.

```SQL
CREATE TABLE project_dev_energy AS
SELECT
  p.ProjectID,
  COUNT(pa.VolunteerID) AS NumDevelopers,
  COALESCE(SUM(pa.Hours), 0) AS TotalHours
FROM
  project AS p

```Datalog
project_with_developers(ProjectID) ←

project_without_developers(ProjectID) ←
  project_name(ProjectID, _).
  !project_with_developers(ProjectID)
